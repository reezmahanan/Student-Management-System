# Student Management System

Simple console-based Java student management system with three classes:

- `Main.java` — program entry point
- `Student.java` — student model
- `StudentManager.java` — manages a list of students

How to run

1. Open the project in an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended) or build with javac.
2. Compile:

```powershell
javac -d out src\*.java
```

3. Run:

```powershell
java -cp out Main
```

Notes

- This repo currently contains an IntelliJ project configuration (`.idea`) and the source under `src/`.
- If you want, I can clean the repo by adding `.idea` to `.gitignore` and removing the folder from the repository's history.
